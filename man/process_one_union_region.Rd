\title{Process a single union of genomic regions to find consensus peaks}
\usage{
process_one_union_region(region_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{region_data}{A tibble containing peak data for a single union region.
Must include columns: \code{start_union}, \code{end_union}, \code{start}, \code{end},
and \code{seqnames}.}
}
\value{
A tibble with the new consensus peaks in BED-like format (seqnames,
start, end), or \code{NULL} if no peaks are found.
}
\description{
This is a core processing function that takes a dataframe representing all
peaks that fall within a single merged "union" region. It calculates a new
set of consensus peaks based on a combined probabilistic landscape derived
from the original peaks.
